Jordan is working on a game where the player needs to enter a number between 1 and 100, but the code does not seem to be working correctly. What could be wrong with the code below?

Answer: Range criteria are easy to get wrong. Change the conditional to any of the following:
while guess < 1 or guess > 100
while guess <= 0 or guess >= 101
while not (guess > 0 and guess < 101)
while not (guess >= 1 and guess <= 100)
Create an example with a loop that never exits. (These are called infinite loops.)
Note that it says infinite loops, which is really similar to the term indefinite loops. They are not the same thing.
Examples:
Loops where the loop control variable is never modified
(Example: while guess != 0, and then guess is never changed in the loop)
Loops where the exit condition can never be satisfied
(Example: while guess < 100 or guess > 0)
The forever loop
