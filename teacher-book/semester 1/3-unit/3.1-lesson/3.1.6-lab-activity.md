Lab activity
If students are working on Activity 1 independently, then monitor students closely to ensure they finish the activity in a timely manner.
If you are spending one day on this lesson, then provide students who do not have a project from Lesson 2.5 with a starter project. One is available in the instructor materials for this lesson.
Encourage students to use their “helping trios” groups to show off their work and ask for help.
