Lab introduction
Provide the list of enhancements to the Guess My Number game that you want students to implement. You can determine those ahead of time, you can pick from the list that you compile after the bell ringer, or you can collaborate with the students on the list of requirements.
A slide is available in the slide deck for that purpose.
