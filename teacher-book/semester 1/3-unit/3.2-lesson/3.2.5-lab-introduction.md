Lab introduction
Review the Lab 3.3 document with the students. Make sure they understand the rubric for the lab.
They are also expected to be able to use the blocks from earlier lessons without needing more guidance. Step 1 of Part 1 highlights this; students are expected to know how to create variables and give them good names.
Review the questions at the end of each section and the quiz at the end of the lab.
