Lab activity
The lab has three parts.
Part 1 is the meat of the lab and is expected to take the longest amount of time.
Students will be creating two arrays to track high scores and names.
They will add to these lists using a loop as the game is played.
Some of the concepts in this part can be a little tricky to understand; be prepared to support students with some examples.
Part 2 is where they can see their high score lists.
They create another loop to display the high score lists.
They will also use text blocks to join data together for display.
Part 3 fixes some glitches that were introduced with the high score tracking.
The problems are:
A new high score will wipe everything else off the table unless the for loop is broken.
The game restarts with the same score, lives, and enemy speed as before.
Both problems are addressed. Stress to students this kind of adjustment is often needed in projects when new features are added.
