# Accommodations & differentiation

There are three additional project descriptions for students who cannot come up with a game idea. The project descriptions from Unit 2 also can be used. You can use these as you see fit, either to aid students who require it, or as project ideas for the entire class. One idea is tailored for students who like the design aspects of game making rather than the coding aspects.
