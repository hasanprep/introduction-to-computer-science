# Lab activity

All three activities coach the students through the concepts presented in the lesson. Monitor students closely; point misdirected students in the right direction without too much hand-holding. If there is a concept that most of the class seems to be missing, then feel free to interrupt their work to talk with the whole class.
- Some of the extensions have hints, which are provided together at the end of the student guide. Modify the document ahead of time if you would rather have the students ask you for hints.
- The final extension for Activity 2 involves students sharing patterns with their “helping trios” and trying to duplicate them. This easily can be extended into a day on its own in which students trade challenges with each other and then compare code afterward.
- Similarly, in the first extension for Activity 3, students create challenges for the teammates in their “helping trios.” Again, this easily can stretch into an extra day.
- The final extension for Activity 3 is a research project. You could have students who finish early collaborate on the research project and give a presentation to the class.
  
- Activity 3 covers just the basics of Debug Mode in MakeCode Arcade. During the debrief, feel free to share your own tips and techniques when using a debugger.
