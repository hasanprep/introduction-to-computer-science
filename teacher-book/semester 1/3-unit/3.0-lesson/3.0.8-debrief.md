When working with repeat loops in Activity 1, were there any numbers that were not allowed? Were there any numbers that worked in unexpected ways?
Answer: In Blocks, the repeat loop only accepts integers (whole numbers). If you enter a decimal number instead, then MakeCode rounds it to the nearest integer. If you enter zero or a negative integer, the loop will get skipped, as the loop will have no iterations to run.
From Activity 1, what are some examples of where you could use the first mechanism in a game, where a button press generates sprites that appear in random locations on the screen?
Examples:
Randomly place sprites on the screen to block enemy movement
Randomly place friendly sprites on the screen to assist the hero in some way
From Activity 1, what are some examples of where you could use the second mechanism in a game where a button press generates projectiles that travel in random directions from your hero character?
What if the projectiles bounce off the edges of the screen, too?
Examples:
Fire projectiles from the hero sprite to attack enemies
Release a shield from the hero sprite
Send friendly sprites out to gather food
From Activity 2, when might you use loops to place sprites in a pattern?
Examples:
Stage setup for games like Galaga, Space Invaders, or Breakout
Create a background for your game
Setup a card game like Memory
