Lab introduction
Display the code for the bell ringer project. (A slide with sample code is provided in the slide deck, or you can showcase a studentâ€™s work instead.) Note the duplicate blocks.
Inform the students that they will learn tools over the next few days that can reduce their reliance on duplicating blocks.
