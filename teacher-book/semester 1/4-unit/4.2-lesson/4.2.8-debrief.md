# Debrief

1. Why does the return block have a special shape?\
From the student guide: “Notice the shape of the return block. It looks like a puzzle piece, like many of our other blocks… but its shape is different. Notice the bottom of the block is flat. You cannot attach other blocks to the bottom of a return block. That is because no further code in the function can run once a value has been returned and control goes back to the calling block.”
1. How might you use functions with return values in future games? What are some examples of functions that you might create?\
As with the previous lesson, spend time on this debrief question and collect ideas from the class. If the functions are specific to a single game, explore how the functions might be made more generic to be used in many games.
1. There is a slide in the deck that provides students with some tips about return values. Review the guidance provided there.
   
1. Some students might get excited at the idea of creating a card-based game. Card games are challenging to implement. Carefully consider solicitations for card-based games for the unit project.
