Bell ringer
The goal of the bell ringer is to draw an analogy between functions in mathematics and functions in computer programming.
Students with more advanced backgrounds in mathematics might differentiate functions from formulae. In this context, we are only interested in equations that have independent (e.g., input) variables and dependent (e.g., output) variables.
