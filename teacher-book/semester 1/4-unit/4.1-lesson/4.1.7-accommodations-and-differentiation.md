Accommodations & differentiation
Students who finish the core tasks early can jump into building their game. If the story design is complex enough, it could be a candidate for their unit project!
The second debrief question could be extended into an extra day of practice with functions.
Revisit the list of functions generated by the students.
Have students implement the functions independently or in their “helping trios” groups. You could assign specific functions to specific students or groups, or you could allow students to select functions that are of interest to them.
Encourage play and creativity. In addition to implementing the functions, what are different ways that the functions could be used? Students should build simple games with the functions that they have created.
