Debrief
In this lab, we used numbers as parameters. What are the other value types that can be used as parameters?
Refer to the first screenshot in the student guide. The other parameter types are text, Boolean, array, sprite, and image. (Booleans were covered in lesson 2.5.)
How might you use functions with parameters in future games? What are some examples of functions that you might create?
Spend time on this debrief question and collect ideas from the class. If the functions are specific to a single game, explore how the functions might be made more generic to be used in many games.
