# Lab activity

- **The first activity** gives a simple example of a function that accepts parameters. Monitor students during this activity and assist any students who are having difficulty with the concept or its implementation.
- **The second activity** introduces students to the main activity and gives them a head start in designing a game with multiple levels.
- **The third activity** gives students a chance to express their creativity while designing a game with multiple levels. Students should focus their energies on designing the levels. They should only start implementation if there is time in class to do so. The goal of the activity is not to have a functioning game, just a game design.
