# Lab activity

The lab has four parts, plus an optional Bonus section

**Part 1** shows students how to define and call a basic function. This is fundamental to the rest of the lab. If students do not understand this, they will not succeed with the rest of the lab. Be prepared the provide support.

**Part 2** has students create a more complicated function. This part also demonstrates that things that happen in the function are available to the rest of the program.

**Part 3** shows students how to refactor existing code by adding functions. This requires the Lesson 3.4 Part 4 project to work properly. Students will create new functions to replace large blocks of code in their program.

**Part 4** creates functions which are used in several places. Students also do a final refactoring to these functions to make them more useful.

For the **Bonus section**, students are asked to revisit the Bell Ringer and refactor the code into a function there. This is similar to Part 4 of the lab.
