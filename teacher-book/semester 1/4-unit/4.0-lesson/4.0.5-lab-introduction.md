Lab introduction
Review the Lab 4.1 document with the students. Make sure they understand the rubric for the lab.
They are expected to be able to use the blocks from earlier lessons without needing more guidance.
They also need a completed lab from Lesson 3.4. If they donâ€™t have one, be prepared to provide one for them to modify.
Review the questions at the end of each section and the quiz at the end of the lab.
