Lab introduction
Review the Lab 4.4 document with the students. Make sure they understand the rubric for the lab.
They are expected to be able to use the blocks from earlier lessons without needing more guidance.
They will also need a starter project to complete Part 3. The URL is provided in the student guide. Be prepared to help them open this project and switch to the editor.
Review the questions at the end of each section and the quiz at the end of the lab.
