Lab activity
The lab has four parts.
Part 1 shows students how to build a basic sequential search.
Students use an array of names they build for this to keep the code accessible.
Part 2 shows students how to revise the sequential search for an ordered collection.
Part 3 shows students how to implement a binary search iteratively.
The starter project provides a sorted list of 200 words for them to search through.
Students can also use the word list to test their Part 2 solutions as they wish.
This is the heaviest section conceptually and may require some instructor support.
Part 4 asks students to revisit each part and refactor the search algorithm into functions.
The refactoring also requires students to modify their code slightly, since the functions will return Boolean values if the item is found or not.
Stress that changes like those are normal when refactoring.
