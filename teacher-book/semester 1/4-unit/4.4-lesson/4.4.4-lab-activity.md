# Lab activity

The unit project is expected to take about a week (five school days) to complete. The rubric outlines the requirements for the project.

- Students may not have project ideas they think will work. Encourage them to move forward and help them add features which will satisfy the rubrics.
- Encourage students to play test their games and also have other students play test them.
  
- Some students may be very excited to implement a project that uses playing cards based on their work in Lab 4.3. Be careful in approving these projects, as card games often are very complex.
