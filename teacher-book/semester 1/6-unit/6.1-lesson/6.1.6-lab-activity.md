Lab activity
Teams first decide which project to pursue. Allow those conversations to grow organically but assist teams that are having difficulty selecting a project.
If you have pre-assigned team roles, then teams can skip the completion of the Role Survey document. Alter the student materials and slide deck appropriately.
Monitor teams as they complete the Course Final Project Organizer document. Answer any questions that arise.
As teams finish their project plans, listen to their pitches.
Ensure that the project has enough complexity for the size of the team and the time allotted.
Ensure that the project plan has enough detail to allow the team to complete successfully.
Ensure that tasks are scheduled in minutes and not days. For tasks that are scheduled to take multiple days, try to break them apart with the team into multiple, smaller tasks.
Identify any missing features or features that need additional planning (e.g., more detailed storyboarding).
Identify features with the team that can be cut or modified if the plan starts to run behind schedule.
Teams that successfully complete their pitches before the allotted time expires can begin working on their projects.
