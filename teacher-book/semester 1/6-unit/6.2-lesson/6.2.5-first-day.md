First day
During the lab on the first day of implementation, most team members will have an orientation guide they should review. During the first PM meeting, you can go over the PM orientation guide with the PMs.
When the PMs return to their teams, after checking in with their teammates, they can review the other orientation guides so they can step into any role as needed.
