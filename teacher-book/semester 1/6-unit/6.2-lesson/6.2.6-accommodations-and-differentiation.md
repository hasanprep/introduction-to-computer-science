Accommodations & differentiation
If a student is absent, the PM can step into that role and help accomplish the tasks assigned to the absent team member for that day. Therefore, it is critical that students check in their work at the end of each day; this way any team member can pick up where they left off. If a PM is absent, then another team member can fill in and meet with the instructor.
