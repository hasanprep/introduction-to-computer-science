# Learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Apply the skills developed throughout the course to implement a medium- to large-scale software project
- Realistically evaluate progress during software development and identify when cuts are necessary
- Prioritize features and scenarios and choose which should be eliminated or modified if/when resources and/or time becomes limited
- Record time taken for tasks—and lessons learned in the process—to help refine estimates
- Record iterations of prototyping
