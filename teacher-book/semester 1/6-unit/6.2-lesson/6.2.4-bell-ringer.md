# Bell ringer

On the first day of implementation, go through the outline for a typical day and explain each component.

1. Teams should start each class with a daily scrum. They should go over their accomplishments from the previous day, pose any questions that need responses, raise red flags when unexpected constraints arise, and go over the tasks for the day.
1. After the daily scrum, teams will begin working on their tasks while the PMs meet separately with the instructor. During the PM meeting, the instructor will get updates from the PMs on their teamsâ€™ progress, responds to any questions that need answers, assists PMs with any difficulties that they are facing, and otherwise support PMs to keep their teams moving toward their goals.
1. During the daily lab, the instructor can visit with team members as appropriate to help resolve any issues reported during the PM meeting. PMs should continue checking in with their team members, assisting where needed, and completing any tasks assigned to the PMs.
  
1. During wrap-up, students should document accomplishments for the day, questions they have, problems they encountered, and anything else of note. These notes will serve as the basis for the next scrum. Students also should check in their work to a common location.
