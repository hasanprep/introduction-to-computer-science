Debrief
After students check in their work for the day, they can reflect on these questions to form the basis of their daily documentation.
What was the last thing you accomplished on the project today?
What is the first thing you will work on tomorrow?
Are you currently ahead of, behind, or on track with your schedule?
If you are behind, what tasks can you cut to get back on track?
If you are ahead, what are some extra features you could add?
What is the riskiest remaining task for your project?
