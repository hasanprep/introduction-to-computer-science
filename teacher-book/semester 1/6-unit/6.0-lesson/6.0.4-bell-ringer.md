# Bell ringer

- There is no bell work for this lesson. However, this might be a good time to allow students to reflect on the skills they have learned so far. A prompt is provided in the slides, but feel free to omit this activity.
- Introduce the structure of the course final project.
- Introduce the roles within each team.
- If you are assigning teams, you can share the team assignments now. You can also wait to share the team assignments until the team portion of the brainstorming activity. Similarly, if the students are building their own teams, you can have them do so now or later.
