Lab activity
The activity uses a variation of the group passing technique. If you wish to use a different technique, then feel free to do so.
Students first spend ten minutes individually generating ideas. Again, do not rush this process. Allot the full time, even if some students simply sit in silence. Permit additional time if needed.
Students then assemble into their teams, where their ideas are expanded on by their teammates. Again, emphasize that teammates should not be critical; they should only enhance and expand upon the ideas.
