Debrief
As much as possible, allow the conversation around the debrief questions to grow organically. There is no “right” answer to any of these questions, so refrain from forcing the students’ hands. They certainly don’t need to agree with the methods used in this lesson. They might come up with better ones!
Did you notice any specific techniques that were used (or avoided) to enhance the creative process today?
When working on future projects (in this course or in others), what techniques from today’s exercise would you consider using? Would any of them apply to individual projects (instead of team projects)?
Have you used other brainstorming techniques that you find helpful? Can the techniques work with both team projects and individual projects, or are they better suited for just one of those scenarios?
If students generate ideas that you like, you may want to jot them down and research them for future courses.
