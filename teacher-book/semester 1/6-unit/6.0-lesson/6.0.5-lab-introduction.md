Lab introduction
Guide students through a discussion of the creative process and how brainstorming can assist.
Emphasize that brainstorming is a creation process and not a critical process. All ideas should be welcomed and explored, whether individually or within teams.
Students should not rush through this process. Creativity can take time; if some teams do not finish the activity in one day, then they should be allowed to finish the activity before proceeding to lesson 6.2.
