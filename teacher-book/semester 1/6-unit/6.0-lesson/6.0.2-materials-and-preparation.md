# Materials & preparation

- 6.1 slide deck
- Student Guide 6.1: Course final project brainstorming
- Determine whether you will have students create their own teams. If you are assigning teams, then create the list of teams ahead of time.
  - The team roles specified in the unit are project manager, logic designers and implementers (i.e., “coders”), graphics, music, and marketing.
  - Smaller teams will need to share roles, but it should be easier to keep the entire team engaged throughout the creation process.
  - Larger teams can craft more complex projects, but it may be more challenging to keep all team members engaged throughout the process.
  - Students will select their roles in lab 6.2. If you wish, you can assign the roles instead.
- Determine the required and optional components for the course final project. The materials state that the teams must submit a working project with a marketing poster, and they may optionally create a sales pitch presentation and an advertisement video. Feel free to alter the requirements.
- If you wish to use a different brainstorming technique, then modify the activity in the student guide and slide deck with your alternate technique.
- If you wish to demonstrate examples to give students an idea of the complexity expected in their projects, assemble a collection of exemplars from previous courses.
- Determine how you want students to preserve the ideas that they generate in today’s lab. They will need them for lesson 6.2.
