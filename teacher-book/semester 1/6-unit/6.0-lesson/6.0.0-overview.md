Overview
In this final unit, students will work on complex projects, using all the skills that they have learned so far in this course. Because they have already created some sophisticated projects individually in this course, this final project is designed with teamwork in mind. If you wish, however, you can implement this final project as an individual project instead. In that case, you will need to modify the course materials appropriately.
