# Overview

At the end of the day, software must connect with people. Now, it's time for your students to share their projects with others! It's also fun and helpful for them to see what others have been doing.

Furthermore, it's time to reflect on the whole development process and for students to share what they have learned from this experience.

Invite questions and feedback from peers and guests. Celebrate your achievements! Consider ideas for improvement and future work. Think about how things could be done differently using other tools and strategies. Think about how projects might be adapted for—or influenced by—another culture, social situation, or target user group.
