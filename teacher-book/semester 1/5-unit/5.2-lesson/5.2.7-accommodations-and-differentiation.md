Accommodations & differentiation
Students who struggled with 5.1 and 5.2 may have issues here. Be prepared to provide assistance with Part 1 to get them started.
Designing the initial level requires some familiarity with editing a tilemap. Students may have the same struggles understanding that the tilemap can be bigger than the screen and how that works.
The initial tilemap also uses the placeholder technique, which students may have struggled with in 5.2.
Part 2 requires students to adjust values for gravity and jump speed to make the game act the way they want.
This is necessarily an iterative process, which may prove frustrating for some students.
You can define some values for gravity and jump speed which will give good results for these students. Gravity=500 and Jump Speed=-250 are good starting points for the platform design shown in the Student Guide.
