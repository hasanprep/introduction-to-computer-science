Lab activity
The lab has four parts:
Part 1 introduces the basic tilemap setup for a platformer. This is fundamental to the rest of the lab but shouldnâ€™t pose too much of a problem for students who have successfully completed 5.1 and 5.2.
Part 2 introduces the player sprite, gravity, and jump mechanics. There is an explanation of gravity and jumping here which may require support from the instructor. The implementation is not lengthy but understanding why may require some more support.
There is also an algorithm for adjusting the gravity and jump strength to get the game feel right. Instructors experienced with game development may have additional insights to share here.
Part 3 adds coins and enemies to tilemap. Students will use skills learned during 5.1 and 5.2 here, and there are no other curve balls.
Part 4 explains and removes magic numbers and encourages more adjustments to level 1.
