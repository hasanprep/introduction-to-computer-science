# Accommodations & differentiation

- Students who struggle with Part 1 will have issues with later parts. Be prepared to help with Part 1.
  - Students may struggle with the fact that the tilemap is bigger than what is displayed on the screen. The screen acts like a window, through which the player sees the world. The camera helps to define the window they are looking through. Just because the world isn’t visible doesn’t mean it isn’t still there.

  - Students may want to design a platformer style game right away. They should be told this will come soon, and they should work on a more top-down map.

- Part 3 on placeholders may give students some issues.
  - Students may wonder why they can’t place the sprite directly while editing the tilemap. This is because they are editing a tilemap, which contains only static images. Sprites can move and interact with other sprites, which means they have to be added later.

- Students with more interest in design may wish to skip certain parts of the lab to focus on designing their own tiles. Skippable parts include:
  - Part 3, adding a second animated sprite. Adding one may be sufficient to drive the lesson.
  
  - Part 4, adding an Enemy sprite in step 3. This duplicates the previous Food sprite in step 2.
