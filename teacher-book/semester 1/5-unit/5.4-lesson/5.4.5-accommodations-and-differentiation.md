# Accommodations & differentiation

- There are two short game outlines in the Student Guide for students who cannot come up with a game idea.
  - You can use these as you see fit, either to aid students who need it, or as game ideas for the entire class.
  - One idea is tailored for students who like the design aspects of game making rather than the coding aspect. 
  - Both outlines build on previous projects, and code and graphics from those previous projects may be reused for this project.
- Students who wish to build upon their previous games written in this unit should be encouraged to pursue additional requirements. For example, a student who is building upon the platformer game from 5.4 should be encouraged to add three or four additional levels, or three or four more enemy or pickup sprites.
