Lab introduction
Review Student Guide 5.5 with the students. Remind them this is a unit project and they are expected to use as many things as they have learned so far in building their projects.
Review the rubric so students know what to expect. Criteria have been added from previous projects to reflect the new material they have learned in Unit 5.
Make sure students know how long they must work on this project.
