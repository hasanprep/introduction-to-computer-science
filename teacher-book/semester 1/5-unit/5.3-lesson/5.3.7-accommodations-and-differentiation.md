# Accommodations & differentiation

- Students who have struggled with 5.3 may have issues here. Be prepared to offer assistance with Part 1 to get them started.
- The instruction and lab can be long; splitting them up into two days can be considered. You can split the lessons between days, with Parts 1-3 and Part 6 (animating coins and basic jumping techniques) on Day 1, and Parts 4 and 5 (changing sprite kinds and delaying actions) on Day 2.
- Part 5 on delayed actions has the most new concepts of any of the other sections due to the introduction of flags and the reasoning behind using them.

Students may have questions during instruction. Ask them to hold them until after they complete Part 5 of the lab, if possible. Seeing the actual code at work may help to clarify the concepts.

- The concept of the coyote jump is also sometimes called coyote time and is well defined at <https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Coyote%20time>. It can be implemented in many different ways; the method shown here is the simplest for Makecode.
