# Lab activity

The lab has four parts:

**Part 1** shows students how to use the on sprite of kind Player overlaps tile block.

**Part 2** shows students how the on sprite of kind Player hits wall block works.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. This part also shows students how to remove wall tiles from their tilemap programmatically.

**Part 3** shows students how to install and use extensions.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Students will install an extension that makes animating sprites easier.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. They will then use this extension to make their sprite animate differently based on which way itâ€™s moving.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. It also has a small bonus item that allows students to add an idle animation to their player sprite.

**Part 4** shows students how to use and manage multiple tilemaps.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Students will use a variable and a custom function to manage which tilemap is shown.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. They will also create special tiles on their tilemaps that allow the player to switch tilemaps by walking over a portal or doorway.
