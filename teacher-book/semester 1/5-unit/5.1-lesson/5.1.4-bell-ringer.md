Bell ringer
Review the questions from the bell ringer:
How easy was it to create a sprite that looked just like a tile?
What happened when you destroyed the sprite? Did the tile remain?
Do you think you could use this same technique to destroy a wall tile? Why or why not?
For this last question, tell students they will see whether they are right in the lab.
