# Bell ringer

1. Review the questions from the bell ringer:\
a. How easy was it to create a sprite that looked just like a tile?\
b. What happened when you destroyed the sprite? Did the tile remain?\
c. Do you think you could use this same technique to destroy a wall tile? Why or why not?

*For this last question, tell students they will see whether they are right in the lab.*
