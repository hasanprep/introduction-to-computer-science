# Lab activity

The lab has three parts:

**Part 1** expands on the Bell Ringer to create a Guess the Number game. This is the longest section of the lab, with the most instruction in the lab. It introduces the practical use of the if true then block, as well as logical comparisons. Expect students to spend some time here.

**Part 2** uses if then else blocks to determine if a number is even. This introduces the remainder block from the Math drawer, which might need some explanation for some students.

**Part 3** is a Magic Four Ball (as opposed to the Magic Eight Ball game). This shows students how to use a cascading if statement to make one of several decisions in their code.

Some students may have four conditions, while others may have only three and an else. Either is acceptable, but there is a question for students at the end whether four checks are necessary.
