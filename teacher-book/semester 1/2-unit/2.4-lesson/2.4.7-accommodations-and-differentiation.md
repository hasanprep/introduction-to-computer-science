# Accommodations & differentiation

- Some students may need assistance with the concept of the cascading if statement in Part 3.

- Some students may not finish this lab today. If not, they will have time tomorrow during the other lab to finish any work still left from this lab. Make sure they know there is another lab tomorrow, and they won’t have an entire period to finish today’s work then.
