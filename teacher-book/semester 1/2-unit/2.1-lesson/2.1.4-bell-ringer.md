Bell ringer
In the Bell Ringer activity, ensure that students understand the basics of the variables that can be displayed in the HUD (heads-up display â€“ e.g., the information that MakeCode Arcade presents at the top and bottom of the screen).
The important thing for students to get from this is that MakeCode Arcade creates a lot of values for you automatically.
Solutions are provided at the end of this guide. A script is  also built into the slide deck.
