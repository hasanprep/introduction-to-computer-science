Lab introduction
The goal of the introduction is to define the term variable. Students do not need to understand every detail; they just need a general understanding of variables.
Variables are given names by the programmer.
Variables store values that can be manipulated by the programmer.
Use the slide deck to go through the definition of a variable. During this discussion, you may want to have the students read the text along with you as you read it aloud. The text of the introduction is available in the slide deckâ€™s notes. Feel free to interject your own thoughts as you read with the students.
