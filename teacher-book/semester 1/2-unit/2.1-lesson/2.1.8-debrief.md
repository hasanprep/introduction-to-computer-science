Why is the ordering of the blocks important?
Ordering of blocks is important because MakeCode Arcade follows the blocks in order, from top to bottom. In the example from Activity 3, if you reverse the blocks, then the value of age is not set when the splash block runs, and the program will display “You are 0 years old.”
Why are they called variables?
The term variable comes from the verb to vary, meaning to change. The values stored in a variable are not permanent; they are allowed to change.
What happens when you change the value of a variable? Can a variable store more than one value at a time?
When the value of a variable is changed, the old value is replaced by the new value. Variables can only store a single value at any one time. An array or an object (e.g., a sprite) is simply a collection of variables.
