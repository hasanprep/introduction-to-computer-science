The activity has five parts.
Introduction to the splash block.

Creating a variable.
Introduction to the ask for number block.
Students may try to click the mouse in the on-screen keyboard. Remind them that the simulator represents a handheld gaming device that does not have a mouse or a touchscreen. They need to use the game controller buttons to interact with the on-screen keyboard.
Counting sprites.
Students should increment the variable in the A button event handler.
Students should decrement the variable in the overlap event handler.
As well as displaying the value on demand with B button, students can display the value automatically if it fits their story. Refer to the exemplar.
