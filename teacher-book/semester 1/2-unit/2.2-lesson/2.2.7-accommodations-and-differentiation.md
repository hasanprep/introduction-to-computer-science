Accommodations & differentiation
Students who finish early can explore how to nest arithmetic operations.
Because of the nature of the block environment, grouping symbols are not necessary nor is there an order of operations.
From their mathematics courses, students may recall ambiguous expressions like
a+b√óc
It is not possible to build ambiguous expressions in blocks. The blocks just need to be nested in the desired configuration.
