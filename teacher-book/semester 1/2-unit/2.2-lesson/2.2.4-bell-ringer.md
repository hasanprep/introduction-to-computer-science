# Bell ringer

- In the Bell Ringer activity, students consider their prior knowledge of arithmetic operations.
  - Student lists do not need to be identical. Simply ensure that each student (or group of students, if using “helping trios”) has a list of binary operations.
  - Not all students will have unary operations, and that is OK. Negation is one that most high school students should understand, so feel free to offer that as an example.
  - Different kinds of numbers include integers, floating-point numbers (e.g., numbers with a decimal portion), zero, positive numbers, and negative numbers.
  - There also are numbers that cannot be represented with the on-screen numeric keypad. Students with advanced math backgrounds may be familiar with transcendental numbers, irrational numbers, and complex numbers.
  - Programmers often get stuck in positive integer mode. A script is included in the slide deck about this example of “tunnel vision” when debugging a program.
- Explain to students how you want them to document and submit their discoveries.
