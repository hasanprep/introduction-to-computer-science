Lab introduction
Walk students through the playground setup if you wish. Read the introduction aloud while the students follow along in MakeCode Arcade.
The slide deck shows the illustrations in the activity, and the text is provided as a script.
You also can switch to a demonstration screen and build the playground along with your students.
Have the students work in their “helping trios” groups through the playground setup.
Have the students work individually through the playground setup, and then jump straight into the activity.
