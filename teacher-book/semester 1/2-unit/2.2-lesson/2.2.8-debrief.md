Debrief
Review any operations that students found unfamiliar.
This is not meant to be a math lesson. If students have not been exposed to trigonometry, then there is no need to go into the trigonometric functions in any detail. You can safely state that they may encounter those operations in their mathematics courses.
If it comes up, explain that you will revisit the % chance block later in this unit.
Note that the shape for the arithmetic operation blocks is the same as the shape for variables. This is not a coincidence.
Anywhere you would use a variable block, you could instead use an expression with arithmetic operations.
For our purposes, an expression is a set of values that are combined with operations to form a single value.
Imagine you have a variable that contains a positive number. You need to change it to a negative number. How can you do that with the blocks that you explored today?
Subtract the number from zero (simplest for the computer) or multiply it by -1 (more complex for the computer).
Are there any operations that you thought of in todayâ€™s Bell Ringer activity that you did not find in the blocks today? If so, what operations are they?
Curate a list of operations that students did not find. The list may be useful to explore as students become more skilled at MakeCode Arcade.
