# Bell ringer

Review the Bell Ringer exercise.

Review the lesson from the previous day. Ask students to recall what the following things are:

- Conditional statement
- Condition
- if then block
- else section
- Cascading if

You may wish to review these using the slide deck from the previous lesson (Slide Deck 2.5) as well.

Most of the day should be spent on the lab. Students who didn’t complete the previous lab can use today to finish it before moving on to today’s lab.
