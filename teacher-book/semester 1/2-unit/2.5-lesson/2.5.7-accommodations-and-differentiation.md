# Accommodations & differentiation

- This entire lab requires a complete game from Lesson 2.1. If students do not have this game completed, you can provide a standard version for them.
- Students may need some help figuring out how to adjust the Enemy sprite speed based on the number of sprites destroyed. You may have to show and walk through a sample expression block to show them how they can be related.
- Executing Part 4 may require an example. Again, be prepared with a working example you can show students.
- You may also wish to pair or group students to provide peer support.
