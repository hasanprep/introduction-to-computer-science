Lab activity
Allow multiple class periods for this activity and for the creative process to unfold. The intention is to give students time to work with variables, but students also should have fun expressing their creativity.
Encourage students to start small, expanding their stories only if time allows.
Allow time for students to share their stories, either in their “helping trios” group or with the entire class.
