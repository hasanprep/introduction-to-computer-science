Bell ringer
The Bell Ringer activity is an extended activity where students—with little guidance—discover how to place sprites on the screen in a uniform manner.
Encourage frustrated students to write out the coordinates on paper. They should treat the coordinates like those common “find the pattern” puzzles.
Advanced students can be encouraged to come up with a linear equation for the values of the changing coordinate. Demonstrate how the intercept and slope are represented by the variables that they created.
Showcase different solutions to the problem posed in Bell Ringer 2.4. An exemplar is provided but allow students to share their solutions and other patterns that they created.
