# Lab introduction

## Part 1: Sample silly story

1. For the story that you selected, solicit responses from the students to the story’s prompts.\
a. One student could provide an entire list of responses.\
b. Alternatively, a different student can provide each response.\
c. You may need to review basic parts of speech with the students. Most Mad Libs® books provide a reference list.\
d. Accumulate multiple lists so that you have multiple versions of the story.
1. Read the story aloud, completing the blanks with the students’ responses.

1. Jump ahead to the student guide where instructions are provided for creating your own silly story. Feel free to ad-lib an example with the entire class.

## Part 2: Storytelling technique

1. Demonstrate the storytelling example.
1. Review the code in the sample.\
a. Notice how different sprite types are used. Remind students that they can create new sprite types.\
b. Demonstrate that sprites can be introduced all at once in the on start block or (as shown in the sample project) that sprites can be introduced because of an action.\
c. Demonstrate what happens when the ghost flag is turned off and when the destroy block is removed. Explain that the sprite either must be destroyed or turned into a ghost so that the event handler does not fire multiple times.

1. Emphasize that this is merely an example. Students are not required to use these techniques in their own projects.
