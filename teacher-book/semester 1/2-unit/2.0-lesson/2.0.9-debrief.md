# Debrief
<!---In the original, these two questions are numberes 8 and 9.--->
1. Review the questions at the end of each section:\
a. **Part 1:** What if you wanted to shoot more than one kind of projectile? How could you do that?\
b. **Part 2:** Do the enemy sprites appear as you expect? Do any enemy sprites appear at all? If not, what could you try to make them appear?\
c. **Part 5:** Do you also hear a crash sound when an enemy flies off screen? Why do you think that is? How could you fix that?
<!---why is c part **5**, instead of 3?--->

1. Review the quiz with the students.
