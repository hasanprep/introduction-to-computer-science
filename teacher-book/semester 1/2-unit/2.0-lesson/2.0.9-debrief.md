Debrief
Review the questions at the end of each section:
Part 1: What if you wanted to shoot more than one kind of projectile? How could you do that?
Part 2: Do the enemy sprites appear as you expect? Do any enemy sprites appear at all? If not, what could you try to make them appear?
Part 5: Do you also hear a crash sound when an enemy flies off screen? Why do you think that is? How could you fix that?
Review the quiz with the students.
