Bell ringer
From the Bell Ringer, review the questions:
How can you make the projectiles appear when a different button is pressed?
Can you make projectiles appear whenever the player is moved?

Remind students of the sprite collisions they learned about in Unit 1.
Ask them to describe what block they used to detect a sprite collision.
Ask them what they did when they detected a sprite collision.
Tell students that sprite collisions are a type of event handler.
Define event handler as a block in MakeCode Arcade which is run only when a specific event occurs.
Ask students for examples of events other than sprite collisions.
Highlight examples such as a controller button being pressed, a countdown ending, a game update timer expiring, or a sprite being created or destroyed.
Bring up the on sprite overlaps block. Ask students how they might be able to tell it is an event handler. Highlight the following:
Begins with the word “on”
Has space to put other blocks inside it
Cannot be put inside another block
Ask students for examples of other event handlers they have used:
on game update every x ms
on start
