Accommodations & differentiation
Part 5 of the lab may be omitted or left as homework if having sounds in the classroom would be too disruptive.
Students may need assistance with Part 1, especially on how to make the Projectile sprite appear based on the location of the Player sprite.
Be aware of the possible problems in Part 2 with enemy sprites being created off screen and destroyed when on screen. For simplicity, students may create the sprites at Y=0 with no loss of functionality or visual issues.
Students who complete the lab early can be encouraged to:
Add more enemies
Add Food items
Add a background
Draw their own sprites/background
