# Lab activity

The lab has five parts, with the fifth part being a bonusâ€”you can include it or not at your discretion.

**Part 1** creates a Player sprite and adds an event handler to make it shoot Projectiles.
- This is the longest section of the lab.
- This section introduces the Projectile kind of sprite. It also shows how to make a sprite appear based on the location of another sprite.
  
**Part 2** creates enemies appearing at random locations.
- Students may encounter an issue with enemies never appearing. This can be caused by a conflict between the set mySprite auto destroy on block and the initial Y position of the enemy sprite.
- If the Y position is small enough, the enemy is destroyed immediately after it is created and never appears on screen.
- The solution is to make the Y position no smaller than half the height of the enemy sprite, times negative one. For example, if the enemy sprite is 16 pixels tall, the initial Y position should be no smaller than -8.
  
**Part 3** adds a collision handler between the Player and Enemy sprites.

**Part 4** adds a collision handler between the Projectile and Enemy sprites.

**Part 5** adds sound effects when a projectile is created and when the enemy is destroyed.
