# Accommodations & differentiation

- Kinesthetic learners could use graph paper to draw the shapes with a writing utensil.
- Challenge students who understand this concept to draw more complex figures and allow them to explore other blocks that may be useful for doing it faster (e.g. additional blocks in the Images drawer).
- Students will have different levels of prior knowledge on this topic. The objective of this lesson is to level-set students to ensure they have a basic understanding of coordinates. There may be students seeing coordinates for the first time who may need more 1-on-1 support to move through this lesson.

- If most of the students are not experienced with coordinate systems, then split this lesson across multiple days. Spend at least one day familiarizing students with the Cartesian coordinate system using activities from available mathematics textbooks. Then, spend at least one day on this lesson's lab activity, ensuring students are comfortable with the alternate coordinate system used in MakeCode Arcade.
