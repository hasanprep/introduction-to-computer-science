# Instruction
- The coordinate system in MakeCode Arcade mimics the coordinate system used in many graphical programming environments. It is different from the Cartesian coordinate system.
  - In typical introductory algebra courses, the origin of the Cartesian plane is in the center. In MakeCode Arcade, the origin is the top-left corner.
  - In the Cartesian coordinate system, as you move up the y axis, its values increase. In MakeCode Arcade, as you increase values of the y coordinate, you will move down the screen.
- Remind students of the mechanism(s) that you have chosen for them to share their work with you.
