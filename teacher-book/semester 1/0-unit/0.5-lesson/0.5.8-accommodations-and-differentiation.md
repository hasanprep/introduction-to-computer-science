# Accommodation & differentiation
- Students should work alone on their projects, but you may want to pair struggling students with stronger students as appropriate.
- For extra credit work, allow students to use whatever resources they need, including instructors, peers, and web searches if necessary, to create their programs.
- If you wish, you can add a second day to this lesson for students to share their programs on a volunteer basis.  Work with your classroom teacher and/or school IT staff to determine the best way for students to be able to present.
- One simple option is to have volunteering students share their projects with you, and then show each one in turn on the teacher computer/projector.
- Have a plan for collecting or accumulating the students' programs, which you can then use to get to know your class!
