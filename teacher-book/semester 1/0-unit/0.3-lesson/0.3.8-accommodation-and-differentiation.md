Accommodation & differentiation
Allow students to use whatever resources they need, including instructors, peers, and web searches if necessary, to create their programs. The goal of this lesson is exploration and exposure, not mastery.
For students who are hesitant or unwilling to engage, point out some simple, useful features like creating a sprite and the Sprite Say block, to get them started. Remind them that complexity or "coolness" are not important for this lab.
If you wish, you can add a second day to this lesson for students to share their programs on a volunteer basis. Work with your classroom teacher and/or school IT staff to determine the best way for students to present.
One simple option is to have students volunteer to share their projects with you, and then show each one in turn on the teacher computer/projector.
Have a plan for collecting or accumulating the students' programs, which you can then use to get to know your class!
