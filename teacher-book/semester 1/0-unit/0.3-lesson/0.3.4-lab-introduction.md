Lab introduction
Tell students that they will be exploring the MakeCode Arcade environment today.
Emphasize that the goal of today's lesson is not for them to develop a deep understanding of any of the features in MakeCode Arcade. Later lessons will teach them everything they need to know. For now, they should just explore, figure out what they can, and put it to use however they see fit.
You can give students the link to the Student Experience Survey (or the handout if you’re doing it on paper) for homework the day before. Tell them that answering these questions will help them to think about themselves and their expectations for the course.
Spend a couple of minutes demonstrating how to open MakeCode Arcade and describe the various parts of the environment. 
Demonstrate the following activities on the screen:
Opening the various Drawers containing blocks
Dragging a block from the Drawer to the Workspace
Connecting blocks together
Add a sprite, enter the image editor, and draw something
Run a program
DO NOT go into detail — the specifics of MakeCode Arcade will be covered in more depth in Unit 1. The goal today is simply to give students a starting point to be able to explore and try things out on their own.
