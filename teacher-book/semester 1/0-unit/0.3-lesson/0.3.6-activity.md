Activity
Show students the lab handout and read through the instructions.
Point out the places to write answers to the written questions in parts 1.4 and 1.5.
Call out that for Part 2, students can provide URLs to what they found, or screen shots of specific blocks or features in MakeCode.
Draw special attention to the list of requirements for the program in part 3.2.
This is an excellent opportunity to tell students that all labs in this course will look like this and that they will need to learn to read instructions carefully.
Instruct students to complete the "Getting to Know MakeCode Arcade" lab.
Make sure they understand what your expectations are for student MakeCode Arcade program names (e.g., school appropriate naming).
Verify that every student has an account.
For Part 1, you can either assign pairs or allow students to pair up on their own.
If students are allowed to choose their own partners, take care to ensure that no one is excluded.
If you choose to assign pairs, try to partner students into groups that are heterogenous by ability or background. Try to pair students who do not normally interact. If the class has an odd number, form a single group of three.
For Parts 2 and 3, students should work alone.
