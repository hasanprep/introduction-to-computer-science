# Debrief
Ask each student to:
1. Identify and describe one new feature or block they discovered in MakeCode Arcade.
2. Identify and describe one thing they tried which didn't work like they thought it should.
3. Keep a running list of these features and blocks on the whiteboard or projector.
4. If the students build a pretty comprehensive list, you can use this as a chance to go over a brief roadmap for the course.
   
5. Ask students what they enjoyed about working with MakeCode Arcade and what was confusing.
