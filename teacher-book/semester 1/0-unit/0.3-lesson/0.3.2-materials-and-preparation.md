At least a few days prior to class, ensure that the class computers can load the MakeCode website for both activities. If not, work with IT to resolve the problem and unblock the following domains:

- arcade.makecode.com
- makecode.com
- trg-arcade.userpxt.io
- pxt.azureedge.net
- api.github.com
- immersivereaderprod.cognitiveservices.azure.com
  
You can find the list of sites which need to be unblocked by IT at <https://arcade.makecode.com/faq>.

Make sure that all classroom computers can access MakeCode Arcade (<https://arcade.makecode.com/>).

If you are not able to load MakeCode on your class computers, you will not be able to proceed with the course. Test this well ahead of time and make sure your school's IT staff knows what the requirements are and can help achieve them.

If you plan to have students use Microsoft accounts, instruct them on how to create an account. (See MakeCode Arcade Tips document for guidance.) If your students will not use Microsoft accounts, be sure to have a plan for how students will save their work and share those instructions with them at the appropriate time. Be sure to go to the lab 0.4 document and change #2 in Part 1 of the Activity section to reflect whether students need to create a Microsoft account. If students will not be using a Microsoft account, you may delete #2 in Part 1.
