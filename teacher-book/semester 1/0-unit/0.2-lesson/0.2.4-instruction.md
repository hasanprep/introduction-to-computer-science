Instruction
There is no Bell Ringer planned for the day.
Use the PowerPoint and talking notes in the Notes section of the slides to lead a discussion about programming languages.
Optionally, you can demonstrate different programming languages online using a web-based tool such as https://replit.com or https://vscode.dev.
Note: The code for the samples in slide deck can be found in the text files in this folder.
Have students play the Asphodel Follows Directions game:
http://aka.ms/asphodel
Note: You should play the game before class so you are prepared to walk students through the exercise.
Have students open the code for the game and examine it in Blocks, JavaScript, and Python as examples of different programming languages.
Ask students to find examples of how the program reacts to different inputs.
For example, ask students to find the block which controls the A button press.
They may not understand the code, but they should be able to identify the on A button pressed block.
