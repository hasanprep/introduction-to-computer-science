Debrief
What did students think about the Asphodel Follows Directions game?
What did they think about the code for this game?
Do they think theyâ€™ll be able to code a game like this by the end of this course?
What were some of the differences they observed between the different programming languages? Blocks, JavaScript, Python?
Why can instructions not be given in simple English to computers? 
If students seem interested, this can be an opportunity for a brief conversation about the difference between high-level programming languages and machine languages (assembly code).
