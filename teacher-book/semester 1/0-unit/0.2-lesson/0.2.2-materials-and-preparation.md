<b>IMPORTANT:</b> At least a few days prior to class, ensure that the classroom computers can load the MakeCode Arcade website at https://arcade.makecode.com. If not, work with school IT to solve the problem.\

If you are not able to open MakeCode Arcade on your classroom computers, you will not be able to proceed with the course. Test this well ahead of time and make sure your school's IT staff knows what the requirements are and can help achieve them. You can find all the sites which need to be unblocked for MakeCode to work at:

Check whether student school email accounts are able to log in to MakeCode. It is not required to log in to use MakeCode, however, students who are signed in will be able to save their projects in the cloud which makes it less likely they will lose their work.
