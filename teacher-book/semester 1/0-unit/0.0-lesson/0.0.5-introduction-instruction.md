Instructor notes	
Suggested topics to cover:
Welcome
Try to put students at ease. This may be the first computer science class many are taking, and it can be intimidating. Reassure students that this is an introductory-level course and all are welcome—no prior coding experience required. Depending on your teaching staff and resources available, you may also make comments about differentiated learning options for students who do have more experience.

Introductions
Have all the staff (teachers, TEALS volunteers, student teaching assistants, etc.) introduce themselves and their role in supporting the course. You may also want to have them explain their CS background or any previous experience as well as a fun fact, first program they wrote, etc.

TEALS Program
Give a brief background on the TEALS program to explain why there are so many adults helping to teach. TEALS stands for Technology Education and Literacy in Schools. It’s a Microsoft volunteer program that pairs working professional engineers and software developers with Computer Science classrooms. More information at: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals.
