# Accommodations & differentiation

- Students who have previous programming experience may tend to dominate the algorithm generation process. Encourage these students to avoid pointing out errors directly and help the other members of their group find and fix errors.
- If students are struggling with the level of specificity required, allow them to make some basic assumptions to ease the process.
- In the "debugging" round, some students may go overboard with the level of detail in an attempt to resolve all possible ambiguities. Remind these students that there are some basic instructions that can be easily understood by most people and there is no need to go into further detail in those cases.
