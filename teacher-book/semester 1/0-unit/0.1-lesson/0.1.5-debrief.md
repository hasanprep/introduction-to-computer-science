Debrief
Ask students what they thought about the Writing Algorithms activity.
What were some of the most common problems with the algorithms?
How were those problems fixed?
Keep students from fixating on the specifics of any one error and guide discussion to the general approaches and concepts used to resolve problems.
Have students discuss what lessons can be learned from this activity and how they can be applied to programming and computer science.
Algorithms are how we write computer code, or instructions which tell a computer what to do.
Computers arenâ€™t as smart as humans, so we have to be very clear and specific when we write instructions.
We wrote our algorithms in English today and some of these were physical tasks, but we could choose some digital tasks like printing or searching and write these algorithms in a Programming Language and give them to a computer to run.
