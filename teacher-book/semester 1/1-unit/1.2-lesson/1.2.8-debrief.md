# Debrief
1. Which block allows the player to move a sprite around the screen? How can you restrict the playerâ€™s movements?
This is review from the previous lab. The block is in the Controller drawer: move mySprite with buttons. Restrict movement by selecting the plus sign in the block and changing one of the velocities to zero.
2. Define velocity. How are velocities used in MakeCode Arcade?
Velocity values indicate speed and direction. In MakeCode Arcade, velocity determines how quickly a sprite moves in one direction (horizontally or vertically). In MakeCode Arcade, velocity is measured in pixels per second.

3. Which block do you add to your project when you want something to happen at regular intervals? What unit of time is used with that block?
You can use the on game update every X ms container block when you want something to happen at regular intervals. The unit of time is the millisecond, abbreviated ms, which is 1/1000 of a second (i.e., 1,000 milliseconds = 1 second).
