In Part 2, students build on their skills from Part 1 to keep the hero sprite on the screen.
In Part 3, students learn how to have sprites follow each other.
In Part 4, students learn about velocity and how it applies to sprites in MakeCode Arcade.
In Part 5, students learn how to make a sprite bounce off the edges of the screen.
In Part 6, students learn about the on game update every X ms container block.
In Part 7, students expand their story to incorporate the new character that they added in Parts 5 and 6.
