Lab activity
Spend most of the class time on the lab.
If students do not have a project from Lab 1.2, then provide them with a starter project so they do not fall behind.
Sample starter project with intentionally terrible graphics:

Students should work independently on this activity. However, students can be grouped into “helping trios” and can seek assistance from their group if they need it.
This is a long activity. Keep an eye out for students who are having trouble and assist them as necessary so that they don’t fall behind.
