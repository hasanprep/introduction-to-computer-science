# Bell ringer

- The Bell Ringer activity revisits coordinates in MakeCode Arcade.
- Feel free to use the Guess the Coordinates project (<https://makecode.com/_Rxdaob7mR37g>) to make your own activity.
- Students can also use the project to create their own challenges.
- Students create a “starter project” in this activity. This starter project is expanded throughout the unit.
  
- Students learn about sprite kinds in this lab. These are used for grouping sprites into different categories. In a later lesson, students will learn about overlap events. Grouping sprites into different kinds will allow students to create more precise event handlers for these sprite interactions.
