# Accommodations & differentiation

Students may not be able to come up with an idea for a project on their own. You can pitch and show the following ideas:

1. A top-down shooter game where the player continually shoots projectiles in one direction at enemies who appear and fly at the player in the other. Other enemies may appear and fly directly at the player or across the playing field. Food and other goodies can appear randomly and fly away, allowing the player to score more points or recover lives.

2. A dodge-em style game where enemies appear and fly toward the playerâ€™s position, and they must avoid them. Again, food and other goodies can appear at random, and other enemies can appear and move randomly.

3. A chase and collect game where the player is being chased by an enemy and must collect all the Food which appears at random on the screen. Other enemies can appear which move independently, and other goodies can appear which give other lives as well.

You can use the sample games as examples or use them as the basis for differentiated starting points for students.
