# Lab activity
The lab has three parts:
1. Part 1 shows students how to use the pick random block in coordination with the on game update every X ms block to make sprites appear at regular intervals, but at random locations.
1. Part 2 builds on this to use pick random to set random velocities for an Enemy sprite and introduces using multiple on sprite overlaps blocks to handle collision with enemies and food sprites. It also shows students how to set which sprite is updated using the sprite and otherSprite parameters.
   
2. Part 3 builds on this to add scoring and lives to the game.
