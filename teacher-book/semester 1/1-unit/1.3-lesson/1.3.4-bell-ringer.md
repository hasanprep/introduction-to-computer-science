# Bell ringer
1. From the Bell Ringer, ask students what they think should happen when the Enemy sprite catches the Player sprite.\
a. Keep a list of answers on the whiteboard.\
b. Ask them how they know when the Enemy catches the Player to do those things.
2. Define sprite collision to mean whenever two sprites are drawn in such a way that parts of them overlap on the screen (e.g., when one sprite “catches” the other).\
a. Explain that sprite collisions are an important part of all games—without them, nothing happens.
3. Ask students for examples of sprite collisions in games they enjoy.
   
4. Give some examples from popular games:\
a. In Pac-Man, when the player collides with pellets, they score points.\
b. In Super Mario Brothers, when the player collides with red mushrooms, they grow, and when the player collides with a wall, they stop moving. (This will be important later in the course.)
