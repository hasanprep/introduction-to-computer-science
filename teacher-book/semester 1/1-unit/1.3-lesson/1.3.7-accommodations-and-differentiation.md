# Accommodations & differentiation
- Students should work alone but may pair up to play test othersâ€™ games.
- Students may and should use existing sprites from the Gallery. They should only design their own sprites if they complete the entire lab early.
- You may want to keep a demo visible for students as they code. You may also want to provide the size of the screen for students to refer to when picking random numbers.
- Students who finish early may wish to add more functionality to their games. Some areas to explore:
  - How would they have different Food sprites appear which can score more points?
  - Is that even possible?
