Overview
As the song goes, “…when worlds collide (said George Pal to his bride),
I'm gonna give you some terrible thrills…”
Today, you and the students will explore how to add thrills (terrible or otherwise) to your game via sprite collisions.
Students will learn how they are used in making a project in MakeCode Arcade, how to detect a collision, and how to destroy a sprite when it collides with another. They will also learn how to pick random numbers and use them to make sprites appear in random locations.
