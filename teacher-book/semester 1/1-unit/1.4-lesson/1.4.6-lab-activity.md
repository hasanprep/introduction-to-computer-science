# Lab activity

The lab has five different parts and builds upon the Lab 1.4 project:

**Part 1** shows students how to set the initial number of lives.

**Part 2** adds a new kind of sprite to allow the player to collect lives.

**Part 3** shows how to destroy sprites with effects.

**Part 4** shows students how to automatically destroy sprites when they leave the screen.

**Part 5** adds additional collision handlers for Enemy collision with Food and other sprites.
