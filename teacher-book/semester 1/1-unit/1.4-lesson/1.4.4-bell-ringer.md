# Bell ringer

Ask students to recall what they did yesterday:

1. They defined sprite collisions.
1. They updated the game score when a collision occurred.
1. They destroyed sprites when they collided with other sprites.
1. Ask them what other things they think could or should happen when sprites collide from the Bell Ringer exercise and create a list.
1. Look for the following items and add them if they are not given:
1. The player loses a life.
1. The player gains a life.
1. The player gains or loses points.
1. An enemy is destroyed.
1. Remind students that they can detect collisions between different kinds of sprites.
  
1. What happens when a Player collides with an Enemy is different than what happens when a Player collides with Food.
