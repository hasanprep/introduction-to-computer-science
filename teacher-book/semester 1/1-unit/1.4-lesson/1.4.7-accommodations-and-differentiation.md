Accommodations & differentiation
Students should work alone but may pair up to play test othersâ€™ games.
Have a complete game prepared for students who were unable to complete Lab 1.4 or were absent.
Students may and should use existing sprites from the Gallery. They should only design their own sprites if they complete the entire lab early.
You may want to keep a demo visible for students as they code. You may also want to provide the size of the screen for students to refer to when picking random numbers.
Students who finish early may wish to add more functionality to their games.
