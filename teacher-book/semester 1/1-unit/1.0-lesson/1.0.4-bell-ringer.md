# Bell ringer
- The Bell Ringer activity revisits key elements in the MakeCode Arcade blocks editor and introduces a common set of vocabulary.
- The activities are targeted explorations; we call them “Scavenger Hunts”. Students develop their own understanding of specific elements in MakeCode Arcade. Use the debrief period to consolidate students’ learning, trying to ensure that all students have discovered key points.
