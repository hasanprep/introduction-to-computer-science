Lab introduction
The lab has three components.
In Part 1, students explore specific blocks within the Sprites and Controller drawers of the toolbox.
In Part 2, students learn how to change the variable name that is associated with a sprite.
In Part 3, students explore the image editor in MakeCode Arcade.
Review the work of students who finish early to ensure that they have discovered the key points for each block in Part 1 and for each tool in Part 3. Then, encourage them to explore other blocks in the Sprites and Controller drawers of the toolbox.
