Accommodations & differentiation
If students appear to be frustrated or don’t understand how to play the game, encourage them to ask their peers or prompt them to read the directions at the beginning of the game.
For students who appear bored or think this activity may be too easy, challenge them to time themselves to see who can complete all the levels in the game in the shortest amount of time. You may also ask them to try modding (modifying) the game code – something easy, like changing a variable name or a melody.
