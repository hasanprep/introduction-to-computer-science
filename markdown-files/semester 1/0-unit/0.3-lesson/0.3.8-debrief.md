Debrief
Ask each student to:
Identify and describe one new feature or block they discovered in MakeCode Arcade.
Identify and describe one thing they tried which didn't work like they thought it should.
Keep a running list of these features and blocks on the whiteboard or projector.
If the students build a pretty comprehensive list, you can use this as a chance to go over a brief roadmap for the course.
Ask students what they enjoyed about working with MakeCode Arcade and what was confusing.
