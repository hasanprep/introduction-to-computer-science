Algorithms
The primary activity in this lesson involves students creating an algorithm that will be “run” by an instructor. Students may select their own “tasks” to write the algorithm for, or you may choose to have all students write an algorithm for a single task that you assign.
Suggested algorithms
Make a sandwich (e.g., peanut butter and jelly, ham and cheese)
Brush your teeth
Floss (either the dental process or the dance; you could even leave this up to interpretation by the students)
Draw something (simple, like a house, or complex, like an anime or cartoon character)
How to perform an operation on a smartphone (e.g., take a selfie, send a text message, make a video)
