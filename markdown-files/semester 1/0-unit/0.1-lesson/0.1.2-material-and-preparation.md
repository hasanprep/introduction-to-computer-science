Materials & preparation
Word Wall
Set up an ongoing list of terms and definitions that you will add to throughout the course. The Word Wall can be physical—an actual wall in the classroom where you can pin terms and definitions—or it can be digital—a shared document, wiki, OneNote, or web page. You can do both, too! Make sure to maintain the Word Wall by adding definitions after each lesson where new terms are introduced. Encourage students to add any new computing terms they come across to the Word Wall and share with others.
