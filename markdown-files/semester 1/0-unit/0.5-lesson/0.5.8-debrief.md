Debrief
Ask each student to:
Identify and describe one new feature they discovered in MakeCode Arcade.
This should be different from any feature they used in previous lessons.
Add these features to the running list of features or start a new one for the day.
Ask students what they enjoyed about working with MakeCode Arcade and what they disliked.
