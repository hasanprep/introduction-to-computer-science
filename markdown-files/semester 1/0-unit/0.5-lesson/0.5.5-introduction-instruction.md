Lab introduction
Tell students that today they will explore MakeCode Arcade and use it to create a "self-portrait" program.
Give students instructions on how they will save their self-portraits or tell them they will use their Microsoft accounts so they can save and share their self-portraits.
Remind students of the MakeCode Arcade exploration they've already done. With that in mind, spend some time demonstrating MakeCode Arcade, with a focus on the following:
Opening MakeCode Arcade
Creating a new project
Describing the various parts of the programming environment
Note: You can play this Introductory video: https://youtu.be/aJriRxPAM5A to show the different parts of MakeCode Arcade and how it works.
Adding a sprite from the Gallery to the screen
Running the program
Downloading their program when complete
