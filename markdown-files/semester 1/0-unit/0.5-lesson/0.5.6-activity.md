Lab activity
Show students the lab handout and read through the instructions.
Point out the list of requirements for the self-portrait program in the rubric and where they are listed in the requirement (steps 4-8).
If you are using the bonus activities, point them out and stress they are only awarded if the rest of the rubric is satisfied.
Instruct students to complete the "Getting to Know You" lab.
Make sure they understand what your expectations are for student MakeCode Arcade program names (i.e., school-appropriate naming).
If students use Microsoft accounts, verify that every student has an account.
Students should work unaided to complete the lab but are free to share and consult with other students on extra credit or bonus work.
