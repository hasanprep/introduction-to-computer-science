Instruction
The coordinate system in MakeCode Arcade mimics the coordinate system used in many graphical programming environments. It is different from the Cartesian coordinate system.
In typical introductory algebra courses, the origin of the Cartesian plane is in the center. In MakeCode Arcade, the origin is the top-left corner.
In the Cartesian coordinate system, as you move up the y axis, its values increase. In MakeCode Arcade, as you increase values of the y coordinate, you will move down the screen.
Remind students of the mechanism(s) that you have chosen for them to share their work with you.
Introduce the activity
Remind students of the Cartesian coordinate system using the grid they have drawn from the bell ringer activity.
Define the Origin and remind students that its location is (0,0).
Explain that the coordinate system in MakeCode Arcade is different from the Cartesian coordinate system and that students will discover those differences in the activity.
Explain that modern digital screens are measured in pixels, where the origin (0,0) is located in the upper left corner of the screen. You may even prompt students to look at the display resolution on their computer screens for a deeper understanding of how digital screens are measured. 

Explain that a pixel is the smallest element of a picture that can be represented on a screen.
